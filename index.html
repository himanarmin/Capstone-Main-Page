  <dl>
    <dt><strong>What is Addiction?</strong></dt>
    <dd>Addiction is a biopsychosocial disorder characterized by repeated use of drugs, or repetitive engagement in a behavior such as gambling, despite harm to self and others, now dont worry because addiction is coommonly to drugs, but we might even have addiction to too much food which causes obesity.</dd>
    <br>

    <dt><strong>How to prevent it?</strong></dt>
    <dd>To prevent Addiction you have to avoid it like for example I am a little Addicted to my computer, so what I do is I prevent from opening my computer. Yes nowadays you can hear it everywhere, Pevention is the best medicine and that is 100% true</dd>
    <br>

    <dt><strong>How is it Dangerous?</strong></dt>
    <dd>It is very dangerous because Addiction can cause many many problems, now you might be wondering that whats the big deal it is just that I watch computer once everyday but this is just the beginning of you life and now itself if you have addiction then you can quickly get rid of it because as you get older you might not sleep, in my case I might not sleep at night instead watch computer or many other issues as well so now itself try to get rid of it. Now how to get rid of it? I will tell you about that in no time.</dd>
    <br>

    <dt><strong>Is it possible to get rid of it?</strong></dt>
    <dd>Of course it's possible. Most people recover and most people do it on their own. That's in no way saying that everyone should be expected to quit on their own and in no way denies that quitting is a hard thing to do. This is just an empirical fact.</dd>
